# UTM
Documentation for our open source universal testing machine

[<b>Read the Documentation - Wiki</span></b>](./wiki) 



## Introduction

Why do I want to build a UTM?

What solutions are out there (Link to Dave and Richards combined document)

Why another UTM? Why ours?

What problem(s) does it solve?

What is the overall aim for the UTM project


DISCLAIMERS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE RESULTS AND RELINQUISHING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DECISIONS MADE FROM DATA ARISING FROM THE MACHINE.

## How to build your own UTM

Very basic guidelines on how to begin building your UTM - leave the details for the proper documentaion

# SAFETY INFORMATION AND DISCLAIMERS

  - Moving objects/ Entrapment
  - Projectiles from failed brittle samples (use some guarding/shielding + eye protection)
  - Electrical Shock - Low voltage but still put everything in abox up and ground the box casing
  - Damage to the machine from misuse-miscalibration
  
  



Describe the components

  - Mechanical - ...
  - Electrical - ...
  - Control System / Software - Schematic of how the components all work together
  - User Interface (GUI) - ...
  - Integration with Materiom's database (if this matches with Materiom's goals?)

## Documentation

Description of what is in the documentation and an overview of the structure - add links to the docs here
  
  - Bill of Materials - Items, Quantities, Suggested suppliers, (estimated costs?)
  - CAD files - DXF files, FreeCAD assemblies, CAD library
  - Photos/videos
  - Mechanical build instruction manual - "LEGO build manual"
  - Electrical build instruction manual - KiCAD files, "build manual"
  - Software use instructions 
  

## Contribution Guidelines

How can the community contribute to this project?

How can they feedback problems/improvements to make the UTM an ever-improving machine.

Folders in the repo for expansion module information - environmental chamber, heat chamber ideas etc.
